    <p>Simple Scratch notification tool. Updates the title (tab) bar when you get notifications.</p>
    <p>You will need to "log in" with your authentication token in order to make this work. I promise not to send this token anywhere (besides to <code>api.scratch.mit.edu</code> for the sole purpose of getting your message count); the code for this project is <a href='https://github.com/towerofnix/scratch-notifs'>here</a>. (Your authentication tokens are stored locally in a cookie which is specific to the path you are viewing this on. That means that other pages on towerofnix.github.io can't access your session ID; only pages under /scratch-notifs.)</p>
